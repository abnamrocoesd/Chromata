## About

Chromata is a sketch plugin that helps you find rogue layers. We call a layer to be rogue when it has colors outside of your palette.


## Installation

There are two options to install Chromata.

First option is to download it directly from GitHub. You can either clone the entire repository or go to releases and download the latest release from there (this is the recommended option). Then you double click on the `Chromata.sketchplugin` file to install it. 

~~Second option is to use the link below to install the plugin via Sketchpacks. Keep in mind that Sketchpacks takes some time to index the latest versions.~~ Sketchpacks is down for the moment.
