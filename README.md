P.S. This repository should be moved to Github.

## Installation

**Dunya:** So how do I install it?

**Vladimir:** Just double click on the sketchplugin file ;)

## Usage

**Dunya:** I installed it. Now what?

**Vladimir:**
You have to select the layers that contain the colors you want to use for your palette and press `⌘ + ⇧ + P`.
After, you can press `⌘ + ⇧ + F` and the plugin will select the next deviated layer.

**Dunya:** How does the plugin know about my palette?

**Vladimir:** TODO
