## Usage

**Dunya:** I installed it. Now what?

**Vladimir:**
You have to select the layers that contain the colors you want to use for your palette and press `⌘ + ⇧ + P`.
After, you can press `⌘ + ⇧ + F` and the plugin will select the next deviated layer.

**Dunya:** How does the plugin know about my palette?

**Vladimir:** When you press `⌘ + ⇧ + P`, you actually register a palette.
This palette will be used when checking every layer's colors. If a layer doesn't correspond to the palette, it will be a 'deviated layer'.
Every time you want to reset the palette, reselect the layers and use the same shortcut to register a new one.
